## Description

In order to compete and stand out in a growing industry completely immersed in technology, a portfolio is an organic resume for prospective employers to get a deeper look into the talents, detail and savvyness of potential employees. 
Creating a portfolio website provides these elements in a multilayered platform, as the superficial aspects of design are readily seen when reviewing the aesthetic of the page, a comprehension of design flow, user interfacing and implementation of user interaction experiences are on display. However, when digging deeper through page inspection, an employer can see first hand how code is written, formatted, commented, among other insightful information that can be gleaned from the dev tools. 

This weeks challenge was to create the basis of our own portfolio page to be updated and grow along with us during our development careers, through this bootcamp and into a job ready status where our portfolio becomes an extension of our persona, performing in an interview what sometimes we fail to gather the words and say for ourselves. Having completed the basics of HTML and CSS , we were tasked with creating this site from scratch with the knowledge we learned during class, along with our own independent research of the languages.

## Learning Experience
 During the process of constructing this page a few lessons were learned early on through trial and error, namely the process of fleshing out an idea of a page layout before typing a single line of code. Letting excitement get in the way of logical judgement, I began typing out some html boilerplate, filling in arbitrary content to get a structural basis of the page, only to have myself doing detective work when attempting to style the page later in CSS. This lesson in work planning became apparent and reinforced the use of wireframes for page design. 

 Flexbox- When I first learned of this algorithm for CSS operations, it took a bit of understanding to grasp the axis orientations and how the parent/child operation worked. I started styling my CSS using Flexbox and performed several revisions to get the page moving how I wanted it to, only to discover the value of taking the time to fully inspect elements of the page with DevTools and proof read before going headfirst into styling. I discovered that my first line of code in my html index had a error, I had not placed an opening bracket on DOCTYPE , so when I created the correct entry and reloaded my page, my flexbox elements took on a whole new behavior, rendering my previous styling unusable. 

 Some minor tooth cutting occured in html with the use of some inline styling to assist in image and text placement, margin and padding adjustments and creating space to ensure there would be enough page content to allow the display of linked item scrolling.

 The color palette and overall theme of the site was inspected for its accessibility factor and all elements displayed a green checkmark, so while personal design is an influence, ensuring that the accessibility of the page was a factor as well.

## Usage
This portfolio page is intended to become a showcase for our application development during our bootcamp and carry into our professional careers as software developers. 

Due to not having applications developed yet, much of the interactive content is utitlized by placeholders to display the user interactivity of page elements. Following the links to each application will lead to a standard formated html page sharing the same styling as the landing page, this was done in order to display the function of the user interface, as well as perform placekeeping work for myself to save time in the implementation of future page content.

Prior to embarking on this bootcamp, I have been doing 3d art as a hobby/side interest, so I provided additional space in my portfolio to display 3d renderings and designs I have created to showcase my artistic ability in the area of prop creation and scene conception.
